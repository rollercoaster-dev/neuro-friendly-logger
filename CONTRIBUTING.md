## Coding Standards

This project follows strict coding standards to maintain consistency and quality:

### TypeScript Guidelines

* Use TypeScript's strict mode
* Prefer interfaces over types for object definitions
* Document all public interfaces, types, and functions with JSDoc comments
* Follow the existing code structure and organization

### Style Guidelines

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Use single quotes for strings
* Add semicolons at the end of statements
* Keep line length under 100 characters
* Use camelCase for variables and functions
* Use PascalCase for types, interfaces, and classes

## Testing

All contributions should include appropriate tests:

* Write unit tests for new functionality
* Ensure existing tests pass with your changes
* Aim for high test coverage
* Test both positive and negative cases

Run tests with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Documentation

Documentation is a critical part of this project:

* Update the README.md if your changes affect the public API
* Add JSDoc comments to all public interfaces, types, and functions
* Include examples for new functionality
